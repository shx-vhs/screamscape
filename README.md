Project docs and code for the Screamscape Project: Gestural Vocal Manipulation Based on Sonic Properties of Extreme Vocal Effects. 
Screamscape is based on Angus: https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/angus/

## Current dependencies and packages 

*Max Packages for full functionality*

- AudioMix
- modulo
These packages can be directly downloaded from the Max/MSP package manager.

preparing a dev board for use with CircuitPython includes several steps documented here: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-esp32-quick-start/installing-circuitpython

necessary circuitpy libs:

- adafruit_bno08x (from adafruit circuitpy bundle)
- microosc (from community bundle)
