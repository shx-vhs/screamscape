Project docs and code for the Vocal Node Project: Gestural Vocal Manipulation Based on Sonic Properties of Extreme Vocal Effects. 

## Current dependencies and packages 

*Max Packages for full functionality*

- AudioMix (package manager)
- M4L device package

*CircuitPython*

preparing a dev board for use with CircuitPython includes several steps which will be documented here soon.

necessary circuitpy libs:

- adafruit_bno08x (from adafruit circuitpy bundle)
- microosc (from community bundle)

## In this Repo

- Python code for sensor data acquisition and wireless transfer based on an adafruit BNO085 and feather Huzzah ESP32 dev board
- Max/MSP patches for MIR, DSP and effects manipulation 

The code folder includes:

- BNO055
- BNO08x
	- main: primary code running
	- templates: different connection types and setup
	- util: diagnostics, network config, initial setup


The max patch folder includes the following patches:

All patches work out of the box except for node_v1 which needs the package AudioMix (install via package manager)

- archive includes first patches along with a physical modeling approach of a vocal tract
	- node_v1 includes:
		- simple noise injection via an envelope follower that tracks the voice input, and a value for added amount (0-100%)
		- fundamental frequency estimation with fzero~ object. It performs multiple layers of wavelet transforms on an incoming vector, comparing the spacing between the peaks in each. (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">check object for further functionality again</mark>)
		- Vocal tract emulator based on the Kelly-Lochbaum algorithm and designed by Massimiliano Cerioni
	- hoewever, I think this physical modeling approach without any type of spectral processing is a dead end since I will not be able to emulate anything resembling an EVE within my time frame


- harmonic_freeze:
	- spectral processing patch with fft analysis and resynthesis, with frequency modulation, only works on a small window and loops

- various gen~ patches
	- ideas on how to gain control on parameters suggested by Oriol Nieto 
	- these will eventually be combined into one gen~ patcher from where development will continue

# Current state of development
## Physical Interface - history
- earliest setup was BNO055 and adafruit feather M4 Express with arduino IDE
- sensor hookup via I2C worked fine but M4 does not have native WiFi and BLE support (only ESP32's)
- tried DOIT Espressif ESP32s NodeMCU CH9102X dev board, comes with some caveats:
	- BNO0xx sensor family I2C implementation on ESP32 boards is known to be at most unstable, could not make it connect via I2C (Problems are described [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor) and [here](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=201558))
- tried other protocols such as UART, UART_RVC and SPI, UART is uncomplicated and worked out of the box
- pretty soon experienced my limits of C++ knowledge and searched for a solution, found out about CircuitPython, which allows to program boards with python
- eventually decided to settle for adafruit products because possibility to program with python and fast prototyping possibilities 
- exchange NodeMCU dev board for other more powerful one 
- BNO055 was useful in the beginning but shows data point consistency issues since Euler angles have been used for determining absolute orientation/ rotation (sudden jumps on y-axis due to gimbal lock) 
- Euler angles are sufficient for applications where there is no need for full rotations 
--> maybe BNO085?

## <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Physical Interface</mark>

-  current setup consists of a BNO085 absolute orientation sensor and adafruit Huzzah ESP32 dev board with UART connection, powered by LiPo battery on a bread board
- connected via UART
- prototyping and code editing is done via mu editor
 
###  Dev board codebase

- main.py includes:
	- UART initialization
	- WiFi setup and connection
	- sensor data enabling
	- utility functions

	- OSC client setup and OSC message packing
		- an issue arised when sending osc packages including message list of three values (gyroscope and linear acceleration): max would print extremely high values for the third list position (z-axis) or throw an error and crash (udpreceive: OSC Unrecognized type tag ;. Unable to process message.). currently solved by appending fourth static value which will be filtered in max 



	BNO085 sensor reports:
	
	Motion Vectors - These reports return calibrated X, Y, and Z axis measurements for the given sensor measurement type.
	
	• Angular Velocity Vector / Gyro: three axes of rotational speed in radians per second 
	 • Linear Acceleration Vector: three axes of linear acceleration data with the acceleration from gravity, in m/ s^2
	
	Rotation Vector is generated by the BNO085's sensor fusion firmware based on the combination of multiple three-axis motion vectors
	
	• Game Rotation Vector - 4 point quaternion  
	fused from the accelerometer and gyro without the magnetometer to avoid sudden jumps in the output from magnetometer based corrections (which happens with the standard rotation vector)
	
	Classification Reports
	
	• Stability Classification  
	Uses the accelerometer and gyro to classify the detected motion as "On table", "Stable", or "Motion"
	
	• Activity Classification  
	Classifies the detected motion as one of several activity types, providing a most likely classification along with confidence levels for the most likely and other motion types.
	
	• Step Counter  
	Based on the data from the step detector, the sensor tracks the number of steps taken, possibly reclassifying previous events based on the patterns detected.
	
	- Shake Detector currently does not work and has been excluded 


**WHAT TO ADD**

- [ ] #dev/task normalization and rounding function with values from max normalization pipeline (trial with mo.minmax)
- [ ] #dev/task functions for querying sensor data with different data freqs (400Hz for motion data/ 100Hz for rotation/ 10Hz for classification)
- [ ] #dev/task comparison of several dev boards for real-time application
- [ ] #dev/explore  distance sensor and a bend sensor as well as buttons for state/mode selection

## <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Max/MSP dev environment patch</mark>

## General Settings

- prototyping phase patches differ from final patches:
	- prototype patches include utilities and diagnostic tools such as data visualizations etc.
	- final patches exclude this, free after: "I do not need to see that it works, I only need a flag if it does not."

### Suggested Adjustments for Real-Time Audio:

- **Sampling Rate**: 44100
- **I/O Vector Size**: 126 or 256
- **Signal Vector Size**: 64 or 32
- **Scheduler in Overdrive**: Enable to prioritize event timing.
- **Audio Interrupt**: Enable to avoid audio dropouts.
- **CPU % Limit**: Set to a safe limit if your CPU is heavily loaded, around 70-80%.

## Gestural Input Module

- udpreceive object with port selection 
- routing object for osc messages, current data received:

		- linear acceleration
		- gyroscope
	
	- gesture data
		- step counter

	- [x] clean up of incoming values (slicing)
	- [x] rounding
